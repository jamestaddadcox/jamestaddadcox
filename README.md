### James Tadd Adcox

#### About Me

Iâ€™m Tadd, and Iâ€™m a software developer, a writer, and an editor at an experimental online literary magazine.

For as long as I can remember Iâ€™ve been interested in systems and in the connections between things, and particularly how human beings are able to turn matter, whether itâ€™s marks on a page or electricity flowing through circuits, into meaning. 

I spent middle school and high school creating rules for elaborate games, including coding a couple of computer games that ran at a glacial speed on my graphing calculator. In college I studied linguistics, and fell in love with formal logic, teaching myself modal logic and writing short stories based on boolean operations.

As an editor, Iâ€™ve often worked with writers whose practice includes incorporating technology into their writingâ€”poems generated from code or datasets, stories incorporating hyperlinks and other HTML elements, works written in collaboration with AI. I love being able to publish works that can only exist online, and my interest in such work has rekindled my early interest in coding.

I see coding as an artisan craftâ€”like writing, it involves creativity, flexibility, and close attention to detail, and is a process at the end of which one has the satisfaction of having made something.
